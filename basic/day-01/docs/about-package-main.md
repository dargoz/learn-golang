# Understanding `package main` in Go

In Go, every source file starts with a package declaration. The `package main` declaration is special and has a unique purpose:

## What does `package main` mean?
- `package main` tells the Go compiler that this file belongs to the main package.
- A program with `package main` is compiled as an executable application (a program you can run).
- The Go compiler expects a `main()` function in this package, which serves as the entry point of the program.

## How is it different from other packages?
- Any other package name (e.g., `package math`, `package utils`) is compiled as a library, not as an executable.
- Library packages are meant to be imported and used by other Go programs, not run directly.
- Only files in `package main` can have a `main()` function that is executed when you run the program.

## Example
```go
// main.go
package main

func main() {
    // Entry point for the executable
}
```

```go
// utils.go
package utils

func Add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

- `main.go` can be run directly with `go run main.go` or built as an executable.
- `utils.go` is a library and must be imported by another package (like `main`).
